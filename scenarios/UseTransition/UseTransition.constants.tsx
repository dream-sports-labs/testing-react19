  DESCRIPTION:
    'On clicking quantity multiple times quickly, notice that the pending “Total” state is shown while any requests are in progress, and the “Total” updates only after the final request is complete. Because the update is in an Action, the “quantity” can continue to be updated while the request is in progress.',
